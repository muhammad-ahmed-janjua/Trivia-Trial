## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login system.
- **Profile Statistics**: Personalized stats tracking user performance by quiz category.
- **Quiz Categories and Randomization**: Users can choose from various quiz categories, and questions are randomly generated to provide a unique experience each time.
- **OpenAI-Powered Feedback**: After each quiz, users receive AI-generated feedback, helping them understand their strengths and areas for improvement.
- **JSON-based Quiz Storage**: For this prototype, quiz questions are stored in JSON files on the server for simplicity and fast access.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vue.js
- **Backend**: Django
- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning (Optional)**: OpenAI API for feedback analysis
- **Database**: To be determined in future versions (currently using JSON for data storage)

## Project Setup

To get started with *Trivia Time*, clone this repository and follow these steps:

1. **Backend Setup (Django)**:
    - Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
      ```bash
      python3 -m venv env
      source env/bin/activate
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
    - Run Django migrations:
      ```bash
      python manage.py migrate
      ```
    - Start the Django development server:
      ```bash
      python manage.py runserver
      ```

2. **Frontend Setup (Vue.js)**:
    - Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      npm install
      ```
    - Start the Vue development server:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```

## Future Enhancements

- **Database Integration**: Implement a robust database solution to replace JSON-based storage.
- **Real-Time Leaderboard**: Track and display top players in real-time.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Add animations and a more dynamic user experience.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Allow multiple users to compete in real-time.
- **Additional ML Features**: Expand AI-powered feedback to include more advanced analytics.

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed as a learning exercise in full-stack development, particularly with Django and Vue.js. It is also intended to serve as a foundation for an internship focused on building educational platforms.
